## Question 4: Author and Repository Information

**Context**: The specification's frontmatter currently has placeholder values for `authors` and `repo`.

**What we need to know**: Please provide the list of authors and the URL for the GitHub repository to complete the frontmatter.

**Suggested:**
- **Authors**: `["The Ummah","Gemini"]`
- **Repo**: `https://github.com/The-Ummah/physical-ai-humanoid-robotics-book`

You can accept the suggestion by saying "yes" or "suggested", or provide your own answer for both authors and repo.
